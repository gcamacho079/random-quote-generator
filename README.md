# Random Quote Generator

This project utilizes the [Programming Quotes API](http://quotes.stormconsultancy.co.uk/api).

A random quote is requested from the API on:

- Initial page load
- Clicking the _Randomize_ button

If the quote is under 140 characters in length, the user is given the option to post the quote to their Twitter account. üê¶
